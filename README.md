# OS Project

## Usage
There are 3 binary targets:
- t_db: Program to test database API.
- server: Program for running server.
- client: Program for running client.

To compile the target, run `make <target_name>`. The `t_db` target needn't be
compiled for running the server and client.

Once compiled the binaries can be executed as is. They do not take any command
line arguments nor do they require any initialization.
